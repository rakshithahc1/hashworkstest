First approach is a quick & messy one, companies at times tend to pick a quick root to address the market opportunity leaving further changes harder in the future. The other result is cleaner design. Doing things quick & dirty way might add a short term business value but will accrue a lot of technical debt. It will cripple the future changes and cost of failure will be high. It might also occur when the future changes defy the current architecture of an IT system. Technical debts cannot be avoided in the software projects but can be mitigated</p>

A bi-nodal approach should be viewed by the large organizations to keep their growth trajectory in balance to upskilling & operational efficiency.

												<p class="gotham-rounded-light hw-contact-no our-contact-no">Businesses today are no longer posed with lack of enough data, they are challenged to analyze the right data to gain meaningful insights about their current & future trends. So the goal is to repurpose the data as a strategic input for determining business gaps and customer needs. Plumbing the data gaps requires fundamental shift in the design philosophy of building applications & roadmap planning. Applications should not only be built to fulfil the business functions but also gather right insight to help companies achieve their business goals. It has to start with the design of right feedback loop for gathering insight by setting goals, creating questionnaire that impact your operations or business outcomes. Data is a strategic asset, data driven decision making enables companies to be more productive & actionable. It enables companies to find solution for a problem in a different way. Creating a fluid architecture with right API strategy will help business to build intelligent recommendation engines that answers their customer & market needs.</p>

Agile & DevOps underpin the productivity of software development process. Agile focus on project management & delivery practices while DevOps improves the velocity of delivery & test cycles, enable faster feedback cycles, implement service virtualization, automation, refactoring practices and enable auto-orchestration of release pipeline.

It debunks the myth of current orthodoxy. The core paradigm of this model is to build, test & release software in small batch transfers, enable quick feedback cycles & limited work-in-process inventory. Flow thinking emphasis product development teams to focus on managing queues not timelines, cost of delay, reduced batch size of work inventory, acceptance to variability in response to cost-to-benefit ratio, time-based cadence and de-centralized control. This approach helps the development teams to increase the throughput, handle requirement variability effectively understand cost-of-delay and improve everyday decision making.</p>

      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Technical Debts</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">An urgent business need can push a functionality into your IT system in two ways. First approach is a quick & messy one, companies at times tend to pick a quick root to address the market opportunity leaving further changes harder in the future. The other result is cleaner design. Doing things quick & dirty way might add a short term business value but will accrue a lot of technical debt. It will cripple the future changes and cost of failure will be high. It might also occur when the future changes defy the current architecture of an IT system. Technical debts cannot be avoided in the software projects but can be mitigated</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Platform Incoherence</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Applications & Data sets underlie the core construct to handle any business task. It is imperative for systems to communicate with each other to share information across physical and logical boundaries and solve interdependencies to fulfil business scenarios. The trend towards integration is increasing rapidly to support complex businesses eco-systems, processes & businesss opportunities. Robust digital business platform on solid API foundation has grown out of intrinsic need to react quickly as the business evolve out of markets demand. Cloud & Mobile are driving the need for platform coherence. Meanwhile adoption of agile & DevOps has accelerated technology delivery & infrastructure stability but interfaces often remain the biggest hurdle in a development lifecycle & source of maintenance complexity.

      <p class="mob-business-para">Data is the life blood of every organization. Data eco-system in today's business is complex and littered with data silos. Making business sense out of unprecedented amount of available data is the biggest task every organization is facing today. New external data sources are adding valuable insights to the businesses apart from the data that they already collect. Challenges that confront this proliferation is ability to securely access, aggregate, analyze & share the data for competitive advantage. This mandate the need for end-to-end data management solution - Creation, Integration, Aggregation, Processing, Security, Velocity & so on. This means business executives should understand the need for end-to-end view of data by integration of data across enterprise and sharing them in a defined way in order to achieve their business goals.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Design Clutter</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Many businesses are still learning how to translate & embed digital interactions with customers in their existing technology platform for top-line growth. Be it a product design, data engineering, platform architecture, experience design, or UX/UI for internal IT systems, or data analytics or even agile transformation we help customer capture the value from their ideas & initiatives. With the dramatic increase of business opportunities & technology innovations companies are competing to push their products and service to the customers to be top-notch. Only differentiator that sets the best from the rest is intuitiveness to design principles and creating meaningful experience with purpose and point of view.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Cultural Gaps</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Many organizations settle at mediocrity after achieving early heights. Very few organizations with strong cultural blend leap forward to achieve excellence and endure. High performing software businesses has always differentiated themselves with strong people & development culture. Keeping the people strategy apart, most enduring and transformative companies are fast, efficient & innovative in their software driven process. They have High service levels & availability, Effective Change Management, Early integration with IT Ops & Security, Workflow automation, Value diversity, Low amount of unplanned work, decreased MTTR & MTBF, Server/Admin Ratio with high span of control & Continuous Improvement. Above all, promotion of giver culture among the employees go beyond process & delivery excellence.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Skill Shortage</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Increased demand for new solutions, lack of market insight & skilled workforce to adopt new technologies for customer needs is crippling the IT organizations today. There is a clear demand for the organizations to upgrade their existing workforce and also engage strategic partners that specialize in new technologies to deliver value to their customers without losing the competitive advantage. A bi-nodal approach should be viewed by the large organizations to keep their growth trajectory in balance to upskilling & operational efficiency. High performing companies often collaborate to solve problems, they don't always turn to their professionals in their payroll for solutions, rather they are turning to companies that specialize on particular skillsets to solve problems. Elastic workforce is the new future for counterbalancing the skill gaps in todays connected world.</p>

      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Fluid Architecture</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">To compete with speed & agility, companies can no longer afford to run multi-year program for system implementations. There is a paradigm shift in building software from monolith to a world of nimble, faster, modular, reusable & contextual application architectures sourced for internal & external use. Applications are not built to maintain for a specific purpose anymore, future of applications is modular & convene with modern integration techniques and a cloud-first, mobile-first approach. Fluid architecture enable the IT-systems to evolve & deliver simultaneously with the continuous business change & market demand.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Data Plumbing</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Businesses today are no longer posed with lack of enough data, they are challenged to analyze the right data to gain meaningful insights about their current & future trends. So the goal is to repurpose the data as a strategic input for determining business gaps and customer needs. Plumbing the data gaps requires fundamental shift in the design philosophy of building applications & roadmap planning. Applications should not only be built to fulfil the business functions but also gather right insight to help companies achieve their business goals. It has to start with the design of right feedback loop for gathering insight by setting goals, creating questionnaire that impact your operations or business outcomes. Data is a strategic asset, data driven decision making enables companies to be more productive & actionable. It enables companies to find solution for a problem in a different way. Creating a fluid architecture with right API strategy will help business to build intelligent recommendation engines that answers their customer & market needs.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Agile & DevOps</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Software development is a discovery process, it is more adaptive in nature and not prescriptive. It is all about shorter, time boxed & automated approach to deliver a tangible piece of shippable work at the end of each iteration. Focus is not on writing perfect requirement document & a clean code but more about writing contextual code for tangible user stories that deliver business value. Agile & DevOps underpin the productivity of software development process. Agile focus on project management & delivery practices while DevOps improves the velocity of delivery & test cycles, enable faster feedback cycles, implement service virtualization, automation, refactoring practices and enable auto-orchestration of release pipeline. Leading the cultural shifts of the organization is the most important aspect before embarking the team for continuous improvement journey. These principles apply at large simply to improve software productivity with set objectives.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Flow Thinking</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Flow-based product development approach by Don Reinersten is a rational view to software development process. It debunks the myth of current orthodoxy. The core paradigm of this model is to build, test & release software in small batch transfers, enable quick feedback cycles & limited work-in-process inventory. Flow thinking emphasis product development teams to focus on managing queues not timelines, cost of delay, reduced batch size of work inventory, acceptance to variability in response to cost-to-benefit ratio, time-based cadence and de-centralized control. This approach helps the development teams to increase the throughput, handle requirement variability effectively understand cost-of-delay and improve everyday decision making.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">OODA</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">OODA refers to Observe-Orient-Decide-Act decision cycle, initially developed for war-combat operations by military strategist John Boyd during world war II. This principle was later widely adopted by business operations and took momentum in the software industry through lean-startup principles of Build-Measure-Learn. According to John Boyd, all decisions are based on observations and unfolding of the change for a given problem in context. OODA loops are widely practiced in the software delivery process to respond to variability & adoption of a shippable product with the ability to respond to change quickly.</p>
      <h3 class="mob-business-head">Design Thinking</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">There is a huge shift in the way large organization put Design in the center of their thinking. Design has become a catalyst for change, capable of transforming the way companies do business, differentiating themselves from competition, to deliver value, simplify and ultimately selling an experience to a customer. Design, Business & Technology functions are coming together to apply the principles of design to the way people work. There is a culture of human empathy, prototyping & resilience to failure adopted by organizations today to build their products & services to observe behaviour's and draw conclusions about what people want and need. This approach enables teams to learn what to build in the process of doing it by iterating & pivoting, ultimately building a product that has an emotional connect with its customers.</p>

Investing in IT-initiatives can deliver real outcomes and give businesses a competitive advantage.</p>

We build rule based automation engines capable enough to self-evolve & make new discovery of your business functions.</p>
       <h3 class="mob-business-head">UX Adoption</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Companies today adopt UX-first approach as part of their product development strategy. UX goes beyond mere functionality & usability. Companies see their products as an interface between them and their customers by delivering meaningful experience which itself manifest as a product. Consumer businesses have made good strides in connecting their products &  services to their customers, in the enterprise world UX is still void. There is a paradigm shift in the way enterprises are fast adopting to consumer way of designing enterprise software. We can help you transform to adopt the UX journey.</p>
       <h3 class="mob-business-head">Workforce Collaboration</h3>
      <p class="mob-business-para">Technology empowers people to learn, adopt, evolve & change. Organizations must be built for change, which means how you repurpose the company for the market needs & customer behavior. To achieve scale & to stay relevant companies should need to adopt to new skills, new trends, technology proliferation and whole new ways of working. Of all the needs, the focal-point for any change are the people and their readiness. People remain at the core of any business success. For companies to propel themselves forward, more than right technology they need right people to do the right things. Imagine a workforce that is change-ready and responsive that go beyond the boundaries of your organization.</p>
